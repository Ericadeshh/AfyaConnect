What went wrong (the original problem)

We were working in a shared project, but:

My UI work

Mark’s backend work
were happening in different repos / branches / structures.

I pushed my changes, but:

They appeared in other people’s repos

Not in mine, which caused confusion.

Later, when collaborating with Mark:

Switching branches made it look like my UI code disappeared

In reality, Git was just showing different snapshots of the project.

👉 Nothing was lost — Git was just doing its job.

What we discovered

Git only shows one branch at a time

When I checked out Mark’s backend branch, Git hid my UI branch

When I went back to my branch, my UI was still there

We were working with multiple remotes

upstream → original project owner

origin → my fork

mark → Mark’s backend repo

The project evolved into a monorepo

afyaconnect-op/
├── backed/               ← Mark’s backend (used as-is)
├── frontend-uzimacare/   ← My UI (Next.js)
├── .env
├── package.json


Some files (API routes, Prisma, etc.) were intentionally deleted

Because the frontend now talks directly to Mark’s backend

This is valid and expected, not a mistake

How we solved collaboration

I created an integration branch:

integrate-ui-backend


On this branch:

My UI stays in frontend-uzimacare

Mark’s backend stays in backed

Frontend is connected to backend via API URLs

This branch becomes the source of truth for integration

From here:

We can open a Pull Request

Teammates can review safely

Nothing breaks on main

What happened with deployment (Vercel)

The first deployment failed because:

Vercel was deploying the entire repo

It didn’t know which folder was the frontend

Fix:

Selected branch: integrate-ui-backend

Set Root Directory to:

frontend-uzimacare


Result:

Vercel ignores backend

Deploys only the frontend

Works correctly

Final takeaway (this is the key line)

Nothing was deleted or lost.
We were just switching between branches and repos.
Once we separated frontend and backend clearly and used the right branch + root directory, everything made sense.
